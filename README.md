# Coconut

[//]: # "[![Coconut Project Link](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-Coconut-pink)](https://compvisia.com/projects/coconut)"
A Library (mainly used) for creating games.

Coconut is a game development focus Java library that includes graphics (only 2D for now), User Interface Components, Math utilities, Keyboard / Mouse and Controller inputs and more!
Hopefully this will make game development easier.

Currently, we only support jars (Hopefully Gradle and Maven integrations soon).<br>
While a gradle install isn't required, it is highly recommended.

##### **Currently, we use OpenGL, GLFW & STB using LWJGL (3.3.2)**

## Building Coconut

If you want to build this repository, open up a Command Line Interface and type the following:

```./gradlew fatJar```

Type this if you don't want the included libraries

```./gradlew build```

You will now have the coconut.jar file in the coconut/build/libs folder!

## Adding Coconut

[![Coconut Server Download Link](https://img.shields.io/badge/Server-Coconut-white)](https://server.compvisia.com/com/compvisia/coconut/latest/)

As mentioned you can build Coconut or you can download Coconut via GitHub or via our server.<br>
If downloaded from our server make sure that you downloaded the **coconut.jar** file.
Simply add the coconut.jar into your libs folder and register it in your ide or include it in your java compile command.

If all goes as planned you now have successfully added Coconut to your project!
