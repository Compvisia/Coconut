# Coconut

### A Library made for game devs.

Coconut is a game development focused Java library that includes Graphics, User Interface Components, Math utilities, Keyboard/Mouse & Controller inputs and more!
Hopefully this will make game development easier.

Currently, we only support jars (Hopefully Gradle and Maven integrations soon).<br>
While a gradle install isn't required, it is highly recommended.

##### **Currently, we use OpenGL, GLFW & STB using LWJGL (3.3.2)**

## Building Coconut

If you want to build this repository, open up a Command Line Interface and type the following:

```./gradlew fatJar```

Type this if you don't want the included libraries

```./gradlew build```

You will now have the **coconut.jar** file in your coconut/build/libs folder!
